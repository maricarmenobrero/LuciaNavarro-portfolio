# LuciaNavarro-portfolio

This is the final project created as part of the Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript course from the IBM Front-End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera.

This project represents the culmination of my learning experience throughout the IBM Front-End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera. It has allowed me to apply fundamental skills in web development and create a fully functional portfolio website that I can continue to improve as I learn more about front-end development.
